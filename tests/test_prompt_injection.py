Prompt Injection Protection Tests

This module tests the API's ability to detect and prevent prompt injection attacks:
- System message injection attempts
- Role manipulation attacks
- Instruction override attempts
- Identity confusion attacks

Each test validates that MentaY maintains its coaching identity and refuses
to adopt alternative personas or behaviors requested by malicious prompts.
